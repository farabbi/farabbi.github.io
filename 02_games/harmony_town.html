            <p class="paragraph">Media censorship in China not only causes lack of access to information, but also results in low demand for uncensored information among Chinese young people (Chen and Yang 2329). Beliefs that domestic media are informative, enjoyable, and reputable while foreign news outlets are not valuable contribute to the low demand (Chen and Yang 2329). This finding suggests that media censorship in China gradually changes people’s beliefs and attitudes towards media censorship.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Based on my experience living in China, some people ignore the impact of media censorship because they have censorship circumvention tool to bypass the Great Firewall. However, they do not realize that lack of access to certain websites is not the only result of media censorship. Media censorship also results in jailing of journalists and Internet writers and surveillance of private chats at the individual level (Zhao 20). The control at individual level together with propaganda disciplines and government regulations limit the variety of information produced, and then lead to lack of variety of public opinions.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Media censorship may also harm public interest because it weakens the function of media that acts as a public representative by holding government officials accountable on behalf of people. For example, in 2016, a series of news based on the leaked customer data from Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian offshore shell company provider, showed that many public officials hid large amount of money offshore (Zeitung). Many people involved with Mossack Fonseca for tax evasion and money laundry purpose (Zeitung). One of the impacts of the news was that Iceland prime minister Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson stepped aside (Henley). Some Chinese officials also involved with Mossack Fonseca, but because of media censorship, Panama Papers cannot be reported in China (“Panama papers: China leaders' relatives named in leaks”). I asked some of my Chinese friends and none of them heard about Panama Papers before I told them.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Although media censorship can change Chinese young people’s beliefs and attitudes towards media censorship, a period of exposure to uncensored information can change these beliefs and result in a lasting increase in their acquisition of uncensored information (Chen and Yang 2329). I suppose that presenting the negative impact of media censorship on public opinions and public interest can also initiate the change of beliefs of Chinese young people. Thus, I want to make a game for Chinese young people to reflect on media censorship, so that they may start to value uncensored information and the change of their beliefs may initiate the change of general public’s attitudes towards media censorship in the future.</p>
