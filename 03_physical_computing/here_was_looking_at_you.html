            <p class="paragraph">The freedom of photography is always a controversial topic. As smartphones and digital cameras get prevalent, people get more aware of cameras than decades ago. Meanwhile, we are unaware of being recorded under many circumstances such as shopping in a market, getting cash in a bank and talking to a police officer. I believe everyone has the freedom of taking photos and recording under any circumstances, just as the freedom of watching, drawing and memorizing. We should never limit our freedom because of the improvement of technology.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This artwork keeps recording from an HD camera and plays the recorded content from 3 minutes ago. The time interval was set intentionally because of the consideration of avoiding instant feedback as a mirror or film camera and the consideration of the continuity of decoding and playing. The artwork was made with Raspberry Pi, a LED panel and a camera for Raspberry Pi and was installed on a T-shirt. It is portable and gets power from a power bank. The artist has worn the artwork for four days walking on various places in New York City and made video collages for each day of wearing as well as observing peopleâ€™s reactions.</p>
