            <p class="paragraph">There are many similarities between skateboarding and analog photography. They are both time-consuming and technically difficult. As a skateboarder for a few years, the only trick I can do is Ollie. So, I want to challenge myself both physically and technically by training myself to do skateboarding tricks and using photos to record the moment when I achieve those tricks.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">I practice skateboarding at least once a week. After landing the first trick a few times, I started to photograph with a camera. The first approach that I used to capture the trick was using the timer on the camera and the timer on the phone. First, I check the duration of the timer on the camera and the duration of me skating from a start point to the location to do the trick. Next, I start the timer on the camera and the timer on my phone at the same time. Then, I run to the start point and wait for the moment to start skating. I constantly adjust the timing of the start moment during the shooting process.</p>

                <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/335759743" width="640" height="564" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">After shooting seven rolls of film with the first approach, I am not satisfied with my photos. First, the composition of photos looks similar. Second, the motionless photos cannot well-demonstrate the trick I was doing and the viewer cannot infer whether I achieved the trick or not from the photos. Third, I do not think I can achieve more tricks to create a decent amount of photos in the remaining time. So, instead of using one photo to demonstrate each trick, I decide to use a series of photos to animate each trick.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Inspired by <i>The Horse in Motion</i> by Eadweard Muybridge, who used twenty-four cameras triggered by tripwires to capture the motion of a racing horse, I come up with the second approach that using five cameras with shutter release cables triggered by an assistant to capture skateboard tricks. The five cameras are arranged in a row with the same aperture and shutter speed. Each camera is connected with a shutter release cable. The assistant holds all shutter release cables in one hand and presses them down one by one in a short period of time after the nose of my skateboard reaches the point to do the trick.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">Finally, there are eighteen photos in the final presentation, divided into four groups. Three of them are used to demonstrate three skateboard tricks I achieved - Ollie, Frontside 180 and Backside 180 - photographed with the second approach. The remaining one is used to demonstrate the result of the first approach, in which the animation is achieved through careful selection. All photos are cut in half, reorganized and installed in a flipbook machine made by mat boards and dowels. The accompanied video demonstrates the process of two shooting approaches.</p>
